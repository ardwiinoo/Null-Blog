**NullPointer** is a blog that discusses networking, programming and also sharing source code. Why NullPointer? I don't understand myself either maybe because it's cool ðŸ˜„.

**NullPointer** created using _Static Site Generator_ to provide a simple and fast experience for readers ðŸ™Œ. Continue to follow us because the author will always update cool posts when they are bored.

Sayonara ðŸ‘‹.
